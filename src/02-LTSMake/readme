LTS: HOWTO Training LTS rules for Catalan in Festival
Javier Pérez
Barcelona, 2007

*The* main script is "upc_catalan_lts_rules", and it should be called like:

./upc_catalan_lts_rules allowables.scm dictionary lts_dir

It needs to input files, and an output directory where the Scheme file "upc_catalan_lts_rulse.scm" is created. 

Input files:

 - allowables.scm : lists each character and its possible phonemes. We have created some "multiphonemes" to account for those cases where one letter corresponds to more than one phoneme. This is a limitation of the LTS training: only one (or zero) phonemes are allowed for each letter. The multiphonemes are marked with a dash "-".


 - dictionary: in Festival format.


What it does...

The first step is to convert the dictionary into Wagon's format, eliminating those words with only 4 or less letters, abbreviations and some "weird" words (foreign words mainly) that should not be used to train automatic LTS.

The output file is directly pluggable into $FESTDIR/lib/dicts/upc/, so this directory can be passed as the output directory off the script.

Script to generate LTS rules for Catalan

 Usage:
       ./upc_catalan_lts_rules allowables.scm dictionary lts_file

 Input files:
       allowables.scm  --  list of graphemes and possible phonemes
       dictionary      --  dictionary to learn LTS (Festival format)

 Output files:
       lts_dir         --  LTS rules output directory (the Scheme format file
                       "upc_catalan_lts_rules.scm" will be created there)


In order to change the context when training CARTs with wagon, build_lts_rules must be edited. For instance, if we don't want 4-grams, only 3-grams, lines referring to "p.p.p.p.name" and "n.n.n.n.name" need to be changed, adding " ignore":

echo ') (p.p.p.p.name ignore ' >>ltsLTS.desc
