#abacial abacial AQ0CS0
#abacials abacial AQ0CP0

#abaldufada abaldufat AQ0FS0
#abaldufades abaldufat AQ0FP0
#abaldufat abaldufat AQ0MS0
#abaldufats abaldufat AQ0MP0
#
#    2. A directory named "phon" which contains:
#      2.1 For each file in inputdir, a file with the same name and
#          the suffix ".phonetic" appended to it and the following 
#          format [ this file would be "adjs.phonetic" ]:
#ax - B ax - s i - a1 l
